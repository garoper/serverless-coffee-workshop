## 1. Digging into source code ##
In this section you will be directly with the source code used in the infrastructure setup for both the [AWS Hosted](/0-setup/1-aws-hosted.html) or [Self Hosted](/0-setup/1-self-hosted.html) method.
To do this please complete the [Get the code from GitHub](../99-the-code/5-deploy.html) section before proceding.

## 2. Valid Cognito user account ##
All the API endpoints are authenticated using Amazon Cognito. You will need to have the user credentials created from completing the section [3. Configuring the frontends](../3-web-apps/3-frontends/1-displayapp.html).
